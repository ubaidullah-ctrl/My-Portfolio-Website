    bio: `Hey there! I’m a CS grad who loves building smart and useful web apps. Whether it’s a tool that uses AI to summarize content or a cool e-commerce site, I enjoy turning ideas into real, working products.

I’m always open to learning new things. My goal is to keep growing, build awesome stuff with a team, and maybe even launch my own startup someday.

If you like clean code, practical solutions, and a bit of AI magic—I’m your guy!`
